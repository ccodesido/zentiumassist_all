The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and developed the Zentium Assist platform, a React/FastAPI/MongoDB application for mental health professionals. The work progressed from a foundational MVP, including core backend services (authentication, user/patient management, AI chat integration with OpenAI) and a monolithic frontend, to significant UI/UX enhancements, bug fixes (modal display, crisis detail view), and now a major architectural refactoring. The refactoring involves separating the frontend into distinct , , and  applications, and relocating the backend to an  directory, aligning with a subdomain-based microservices architecture. The corporate website was also crawled and is being rebuilt within this new structure. The final task before this summary was the completion of the independent patient application.

Zentium Assist is an AI-assisted web platform designed for mental health professionals to aid in the evaluation, treatment, and follow-up of patients within organizational contexts, initially focused on professional football. The platform aims to resolve issues like administrative overhead, real-time patient tracking deficiencies, limited inter-session support, and underutilized clinical data. It provides automated session transcription/analysis, AI-suggested psychometric tests and diagnostics (validated by professionals), personalized therapeutic tasks, and a 24/7 virtual assistant. The technical stack involves React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, with MongoDB as the current database (MariaDB preferred for future primary data, MongoDB for AI data). Key functionalities implemented include a robust authentication system, comprehensive professional dashboard, patient management, a functional AI chatbot with crisis detection (using OpenAI), and a task management system. The application's UI/UX has been significantly upgraded. The project is currently being re-architected into separate , ,  frontend applications and an  backend for a subdomain-based microservices deployment.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS (for modern UI/UX).
- **Backend**: FastAPI (for RESTful APIs).
- **Databases**: MongoDB (primary, for all application data), MariaDB (user's preferred future integration).
- **AI/LLMs**: OpenAI API (for chatbot, sentiment analysis, crisis detection), Whisper (planned for audio transcription).
- **Architecture**: Microservices (logical separation implemented via folder structure), UUIDs (for IDs).

<code_architecture>
The project initially followed a monolithic React frontend and FastAPI backend structure under the  directory.

**Revised/Current Directory Structure ():**


*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: The central FastAPI backend application managing all API endpoints (authentication, user/patient management, chat, tasks, crisis detection, analytics) and database interactions, including OpenAI integration.
    *   **Changes**: Migrated from . Extensive modifications for new endpoints, database models, AI integration, and bug fixes (e.g., UUID implementation, crisis detection logic).
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Stores critical environment variables like , , and , essential for database connection and AI service authentication.
    *   **Changes**: Updated to include and later configure the  provided by the user.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Contains the main React component for the professional-facing application, including login, dashboard, patient management, and crisis alerts UI.
    *   **Changes**: Extracted and refactored from the original monolithic . It received significant UI/UX enhancements and implemented modals for adding patients and viewing crisis details.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: The main React component for the patient-facing application, providing the chatbot interface, task management, profile, and sessions history.
    *   **Changes**: Extracted and refactored from the original monolithic . This file was recently completed as part of the independent patient application request, featuring four distinct tabs (Chat, Tasks, Profile, Sessions).
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Manages the application's visual styling, heavily utilizing Tailwind CSS for modern UI/UX elements like glassmorphism, gradients, animations, and responsiveness.
    *   **Changes**: Numerous updates across all three frontend applications to implement visual improvements and modal styling for a premium aesthetic.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: The main React component for the new corporate website, responsible for routing and displaying its pages.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created, populated with content crawled from the provided corporate website URL.

<pending_tasks>
- Migrate the main application database from MongoDB to MariaDB.
- Separate the backend microservices and frontend applications into distinct GitHub repositories.
- Implement audio transcription functionality using Whisper.
- Add more automated psychometric tests.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was actively engaged in a significant architectural refactoring, transitioning the application from a monolithic structure to a multi-application monorepo under . This involved creating separate directories for  (backend),  (corporate website),  (professional frontend), and  (patient frontend).

Before this summary, critical UI bugs were resolved: the Add Patient modal now correctly displays as a popup, and the Ver Detalles button for crisis alerts fully functions, revealing a detailed modal with patient information, emergency contacts, the crisis message, recent conversation history, and actionable recommendations.

The immediate last task, requested explicitly by the user, was to completa la aplicacion de pacientes, y por favor pasame la URL (complete the patient application, and please give me the URL). The AI engineer confirmed this and successfully completed the code for the independent patient application, writing  and  files within the  directory. This patient application is now fully functional, featuring a chat interface with the AI assistant, task management, a personal profile, and session history.

The overall system is operational. The backend handles authentication, user/patient management, and AI-powered chat/crisis detection (now using a real OpenAI API key). The professional dashboard is complete and enhanced with modern UI/UX, including glassmorphism effects and animated elements, and correctly displays crisis alerts. The patient interface is now a standalone application ready for use.
